irc2murmur
==========
An app to post conversations in an IRC channel as Murmurs on a project on Mingle

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) HttpClient gem (http://dev.ctor.org/http-access2/)
2) Basic authentication must be turned on in Mingle
 (http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle/3.0/help/configuring_mingle_authentication.html)

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To set up the app, edit config.yml

A sample configuration would look like this:
The 'protocol' config under 'mingle' takes values 'http' and 'https'.
The 'certificate_location' under 'mingle' points to the location where the app
can find SSL CA certificates for the Mingle server. This is optional, needed
only if your Mingle server is running on https.
In a linux box, if you have accessed the Mingle in a browser, you can find the
certificates in /etc/ssl/certs
