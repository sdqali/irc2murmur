  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Create a new Mock instance with a name and a MockControl to support it. If not given, a MockControl is made implicitly for this Mock alone; this means expectations for this mock are not tied to other expectations in your test.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: It's not recommended to use a Mock directly; see Hardmock and Hardmock#create_mocks for the more wholistic approach.
